Functional Object-Oriented Networks (FOONs) are a knowledge representation system used for robotic task planning and manipulation. This paper presents proposed weighted FOON and task planning algorithms that enable robots and humans to collaboratively complete complex tasks with higher success rates than a human working alone. The algorithms are applied to a recipe graph and the obtained subgraphs represent parts of the recipe that meet specified criteria such as requiring the smallest number of ingredients possible or having the highest success rate for a specific action.  

One of the motivations for developing search algorithms in FOONs is the need to retrieve certain recipes or ingredients when an entire recipe execution is not available for a robot. FOONs provide a quality representation of the relationships between objects and tasks, enabling robots to decipher a task goal and select the correct objects to manipulate.  

The proposed algorithms in this paper demonstrate the potential of FOONs for improving the success rates of collaborative tasks between robots and humans. By using FOONs to represent knowledge and search algorithms to retrieve data, robots can work collaboratively with humans to complete tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy.  

The main contributions and objectives of the paper include demonstrating the usefulness of FOONs and search algorithms for robotic task planning and manipulation, proposing new algorithms to retrieve specific subgraphs from recipe graphs, and showcasing the potential of FOONs for improving the success rates of collaborative tasks between robots and humans. Overall, this paper highlights the importance of knowledge retrieval and representation in robotic cooking and the potential for FOONs to improve the efficiency and accuracy of foodÂ preparation.
